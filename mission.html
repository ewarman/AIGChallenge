		<h1>Legacy: What is it?</h1>
		<p>Legacy is a secure and efficient virtual safe for users to store legal documents such as wills and birth certificates, documents pertaining to distrubution of one's estate, and basic personal information such as insurance and social security data.  </p>
		<h2>Why is it important?</h2>
		<p>The amount of people who pass away without having proper documentation for distribution of their estate increases annually. Legacy provides a safe and simple storage solution to hold and handle useful documents and personal information in case of emergency.</p>
		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
		<p>Users are prompted to enter basic information such as employment records and housing documents, and are also given the option to upload their own files such as wills or birth certificates. Legacy ensures that users' files are stored safely by using password encryption, security questions, and optional fingerprint authentication. The documents are able to be easily accessed by users through their portal, and other users who have been granted access.</p>
		<h2>How do I know my files are safe?</h2>
		<p>Upon login, users enter their username, password, and are then directed to a second security screening of their choice (i.e. security questions or fingerprint authentication). If a user grants access to a member of their family with whom they would like to share documents or information, the family member will receive a temporary access code to enter on their portal. Access codes will be updated immediately after use to ensure maximum user privacy.</p>
