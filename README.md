Our prototype for the AIG Challenge!

Inspired by this article (http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/nyregion/dying-alone-in-new-york-city.html), our team decided to create Legacy, a digital locker for estate planning. In our research, we found some scary statistics about estate planning in America. 

According to Arden Besunder Law Offices:<br>

1. One in ten (10%) of American adults who do not have any elements of an estate plan say it is because they do not want to think about dying or becoming incapacitated <br>
2. One in ten (9%) of adults say they don’t have an estate plan in place because they don’t know who to talk to about creating such documents<br>
3. One in four (24%) say their biggest reason for not having a plan is a lack of sufficient assets. <br>

Legacy addresses these three major concerns in a few ways:

1. We're not focused on death. We're focused on you. Users can upload whatever documents they want, including family trees, photos, notes, and videos. By allowing users to archive their lives as well as upload legal documents, we hope to remove some fear and add some fun to estate planning. <br>
2. We believe that some of the most important things to leave behind aren't legal documents. With Legacy, you have the power, not your lawyer. <br>
3. People are so much more than the material assets they have. We want everyone to be able to leave the legacy they want behind. By allowing users to create holistic representations of themselves, we hope to make estate planning feel valuable to everyone.
